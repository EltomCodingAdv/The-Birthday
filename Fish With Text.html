        <span class="poem-line">Today dawns with golden light,</span><br>
        <span class="poem-line">A gift of you in every ray.</span><br>
        <span class="poem-line">I pause to celebrate your heart,</span><br>
        <span class="poem-line">And all the warmth you bring each day.</span><br>

        <span class="poem-line">My life is richer, full of hope,</span><br>
        <span class="poem-line">Because I know that you are near.</span><br>

        <span class="poem-line">You hold a forever special place.</span><br>
